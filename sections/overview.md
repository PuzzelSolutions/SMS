## Introduction
This documentation describes the functionality of, and explains how to integrate with, the Puzzel SMS Gateway (SMSGW). 

The SMSGW is an API that enables your solution(s) to send and receive SMS messages, both single messages and bigger batches of messages using the same API. 

To be able to connect to the SMSGW you will need a service configured by Puzzel with sensible defaults and settings for your use case.  The service identifiers are serviceid, as well as a username and password. Please contact Puzzel Support ([help.puzzel.com](https://help.puzzel.com "Puzzel Help")) if you want to create an agreement, get a demo account or if you have an active agreement but have not received these credentials.

The SMSGW has three main functionalities with corresponding APIs:

- Sending one or many SMS messages from your system to end-users (MT)
- Receiving SMS messages from end-users to your system (MO)
- Receiving delivery reports to your system for SMS messages sent to end-users (DR)

To send SMS messages to end-users, you need to integrate with one of the APIs via REST (XML, JSON or web form over HTTP POST), Web Service (with corresponding WSDL), email (SMTP), SMPP or via HTTP GET (with query parameters). 

Due to the flexibility of the REST / SOAP interfaces, we generally recommend that you choose to integrate with one of these endpoints if possible.

To receive SMS messages (MO) or delivery reports (DR) you need to provide a service endpoint that can receive HTTP GET or POST requests. As an alternative, you can also receive MO messages as email messages (SMTP) or using the SMPP protocol.

Additionally, the Gateway provides a Management API to manage messages. A description of this API is given [here](/sections/interfaces/management-api.md).
